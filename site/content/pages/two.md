# Page Two
High, welcome to another page of my boring website.

Notice how this page doesn't show up on the home page. That is because it is in a subdirectory of content (the pages folder). When you put files inside a subdirectory, the entry type changes from the default type to a new type that matches the name of the parent folder. In this case the entry type for this file is "pages".
